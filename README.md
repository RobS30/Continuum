# Continuum

For our first project, we were challenged to create a web page using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  On the backend, it had to use Javascript to connect to a database and execute several server-side API requests.  

Our website--Continuum--was designed to be a learning tool disguised as a space travel agency.    

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Jquery
- Firebase database
- NASA and Youtube API
